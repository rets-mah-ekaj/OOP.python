## Let's Begin...

> We will be understanding the concepts of Object Oriented Programming in Python by developing a store management system from scratch.

### What problems does OOP solve?
- You can directly open the code from above, or you can [click here](./Video_1.ipynb).

**In video_1.ipynb**, we can see that all the variables are having prefix for variable description as item1. But for python, those are just variables.
- When we print the types of those variables, we will get the type of the variables with no surprise.
- Please note here, we can also see the keywords 'class' in the output. This implies that the variables that we declared and initiated are nothing but the instances of the class *'str' and 'int'*.
- In python programming language, each data types is an object that has been instantiated earlier by some class. Here, for **'item1'** variable, string type of class is instantiated and for **'item1_price', 'item1_quantity' and 'item1_price_total'** variables, integer type of class was instantiated.

### Let's create a class!
